# Tic-Tac-Toe with Mini-Max Algorithm
This repository contains two implementations of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where one uses the basic Mini-Max algorithm and the other improves upon it by optimizing the time complexity with Alpha-Beta pruning.

Features
Single-player mode (Player vs Computer).
Multiplayer mode (Player vs Player).
AI powered by the Mini-Max algorithm for optimal gameplay.
Improved AI with Alpha-Beta pruning for faster computation.
Files
Basic Mini-Max Implementation: The initial implementation of the Mini-Max algorithm to evaluate the game tree for the AI's moves.
Optimized Mini-Max with Alpha-Beta Pruning: An improved version of the Mini-Max algorithm that reduces the number of game states evaluated.
How It Works
Mini-Max Algorithm
The Mini-Max algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory. It evaluates the possible moves in the game to determine the optimal move for the computer.

Alpha-Beta Pruning
Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization of the Mini-Max algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree, significantly improving performance without sacrificing accuracy.

Usage
Clone the repository.
Run the file Tic Tac Toe.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Follow the prompts to select the game mode:
Single-player (Computer vs Player).
Multiplayer (Player vs Player).

Example
Player inputs positions as numbers between 1â€“9.
The game displays the board after each move.
The AI calculates the optimal move using the chosen algorithm.
